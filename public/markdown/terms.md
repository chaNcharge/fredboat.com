*Last modified 23rd May 2018*

Please note: I am not a lawyer and I am not sure about what I am doing

1. You agree to the terms of service if you use the public FredBoat. This excludes any selfhosted version you might use.
2. You accept all responsibility for streaming copyrighted material.
3. These terms may be changed without notice.
4. You agree that the service shall be deemed solely based in Denmark.

## Privacy policy
FredBoat is a large open source project managed by Frederik Mikkelsen and volunteers in our spare time. We are not in
the business of selling your data. Nevertheless, we need to receive and process data in order to provide our service.

Most of the data that we receive are shared by Discord under their API terms of service. We do not share your data with
others. The only data that we retain are your FredBoat preferences, as well as identification numbers referring to
Discord entities like servers and users.

### Right to erasure
If you wish to have our very limited data about you wiped from our database, please get in touch.
